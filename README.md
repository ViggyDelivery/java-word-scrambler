# java-word-scrambler
A Java-based word scrambler game that takes in a list of elementary school spelling bee words and rearranges the inner characters so that the player has to guess the original word.

This program was built a few months ago to help my brother prepare for his then-upcoming school-wide spelling bee while also strengthening my knowledge on ArrayLists and HashMaps. I first assign the numbers 1-451 each to the corresponding word in the text file using a HashMap. Afterwards, once the user enters a number to retrieve the word, I use a couple of helper methods to randomize the inner characters of the word, leaving the first and last characters intact if the word's length is greater than 4 and keeping only the first letter intact if the length is less than or equal to 4. The user is then prompted to try and guess what the word is, and when they finally guess the word, a point is added to their total score. Once the user decides to quit the game, they will see how many words they have found, represented as points.

And yes, I know this was probably a very inefficient and lengthy way to go about randomizing letters in a word, but I wanted to do it this way to further familiarize myself with ArrayLists and HashMaps, two data structures that I had just recently learned.
